# Backlog — App Store submission

Tracked follow-up work after the sandbox-compliance build
(`pii_buddy/mac_sandbox/`). See `app_store_sandbox.md` for the full
writeup of what's implemented/tested vs. unverified, and the
"if you're picking this up to actually ship it" section for the
detailed order of operations.

## Next immediate step — free sandbox smoke test (DO THIS FIRST)

Do this before spending money or time on Apple Developer enrollment/certs.
It answers the single biggest open risk for free, using **ad-hoc code
signing** (no Apple Developer Program membership required — `codesign
--sign -` applies real entitlements and gets real App Sandbox enforcement
on your own Mac, it just can't be distributed to anyone else).

Status as of this writing: **not yet run.** Nobody has executed this on
real macOS yet — everything below is the plan, not a result.

```bash
cd ~/code/pii_buddy   # or wherever the clone lives
./setup.sh            # skip if already set up

./extras/build_py2app_mas.sh
# produces dist/mas/PII Buddy.app, UNSIGNED — expected, sign it next

codesign --deep --force --options runtime \
  --entitlements extras/entitlements_mas.plist \
  --sign - \
  "dist/mas/PII Buddy.app"

codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 "dist/mas/PII Buddy.app"
# should report no errors
```

Then:
1. Open **Console.app** (Spotlight → "Console"), filter/search for
   `sandboxd`, leave it running and visible.
2. `open "dist/mas/PII Buddy.app"` — Gatekeeper will likely block first
   launch since it's ad-hoc signed; right-click the app in Finder → Open
   → confirm.
3. Click the menu bar icon → **"Choose Watch Folder…"** (this menu item
   auto-appears — the MAS build sets its own `PII_BUDDY_MAS_BUILD` flag
   via `LSEnvironment`, no manual env var needed). Pick any folder in the
   real NSOpenPanel that appears.
4. Drop a test `.txt` file with an obviously fake name/email into that
   folder.
5. **Read the result:**
   - **Success:** a redacted output file appears within a few seconds,
     no `sandboxd` denials in Console.
   - **Failure:** nothing happens, or Console shows something like
     `sandboxd: deny(1) file-read/file-write...` — this means
     `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource` isn't actually granting
     `watchdog` access inside the sandbox, and the "watch a folder in the
     background" UX would need to become drag-and-drop instead. This
     would be a real, structural finding — not a bug to just patch.

Whatever happens, capture the Console.app output (verbatim, especially
any `deny` lines) before moving on to certs/provisioning below.

## Blocking submission (after the smoke test above passes)

- [ ] Get an Apple Developer Program membership (if not already enrolled).
- [ ] Create the "3rd Party Mac Developer Application" and "3rd Party Mac
      Developer Installer" certificates + a provisioning profile for the
      chosen Bundle ID, in the Apple Developer portal / Xcode.
- [ ] Re-run the build, this time with `MAS_APP_SIGNING_ID` /
      `MAS_INSTALLER_SIGNING_ID` set to the real certs (see
      `extras/build_py2app_mas.sh` header comment for the exact env var
      names/format), plus the provisioning profile copied into
      `dist/mas/embedded.provisionprofile` before signing.
- [ ] Build and verify the signed `.pkg` installs and runs sandboxed on a
      clean Mac, not just the dev machine.
- [ ] Create the App Store Connect listing: metadata, screenshots, privacy
      questionnaire, review notes. Listing copy already drafted from an
      earlier session — needs to be pasted in.
- [ ] Submit for App Review (TestFlight beta first). Budget for at least
      one rejection cycle — Apple may reject the "watch a folder in the
      background" pattern outright regardless of correct entitlements.

## Known gaps, unrelated to this work

- [x] ~~Pre-existing bug: `main.py --once` throws `FileNotFoundError` in
      non-MAS `--dir` mode~~ — root-caused and fixed: `ensure_dirs()`
      referenced a stale `ALL_DIRS`/`USER_BLOCKLISTS_DIR` binding captured
      at import time, so a `--dir` override's directories were never
      actually created before the file copy ran. The `--dir` override
      block was also missing `USER_BLOCKLISTS_DIR`/`FEEDBACK_DIR` from the
      dirs it created. Both fixed; regression tests in
      `tests/test_dir_override.py`.
- [ ] Bookmark staleness behavior across OS upgrades, volume renames, or
      iCloud Drive folders is only observable through real, long-term
      usage — current code logs a warning and proceeds on `is_stale`, UX
      not yet validated.
